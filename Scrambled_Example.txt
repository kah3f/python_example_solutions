This "Cdribagme Eeffct" is sort of ture, but it does not tlel the whloe sotry.
It is rvleialtey easy to raed short wodrs, but not so esay wehn rndeaig leognr
wrdos. Aals, most cennott wodrs in Esgnilh are sveen ltreets lnog or lngoer --
the mroe letters three are in a word, the mroe dliufcift and cpmleoactid it
bemceos to cerrctoly itefindy them wehn the letrtes are raerngaerd. Waeerhs,
more duiivntime and coommn wodrs lkie "blal" and "bear" rmaein motsly uaencghnd
and easy to rnizeocge, lgneor, less cmomon wrods, lkie "pouliotln" and
"stulanmoeuis" cnghae sibsntllautay to the pinot whree rgonoctiein is secracly
pbislsoe. Fmrohturree, tihs ailibty setms from a graet dael of eerpeixnce
rdaeing clcteorry seeplld wodrs -- only poplee who can araeldy raed piofnrtciely
can do tihs tsak. This ticrk deos not rveael mcuh aobut the pceross of lreaning
to raed -- it only itdieacns that hhlgiy slikled rdreeas are so ptcacired wtih
text they can orvcmoee mnior ifocpietnrems (ehspaims on the wrod "mrnio") in
the pnrit to access manneig.
